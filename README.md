# SmartOn: Just-in-Time Active Event Detection on Energy Harvesting Systems
This repository holds the relevant project files for SmartON, an energy harvesting system that performs active event detection by using reinforcement learning.

## TI_CCS
This folder includes files for CCS project. You can create a new empty project in CCS and then copy those files to the project. It should work. This project uses driverlib library so when you create a new empty project in CCS, be sure to choose "MSP430 DriverLib -> Empty Project with DriverLib Source" under the "Project templates and examples". The target board is MSP430Fr5994. This project was developed in CCS Version: 9.1.0.00010 

## Hardware
This folder includes files for designing the PCB board and library files for some components. This project was developed with Eagle. 

## Simulation
This folder includes files for the software simulation.

Each subfolder has their own README file, please go there for more detailed explanation.
